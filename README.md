# NPQIP

About the code

The deployment is at https://ecrf1.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk/npqip

About the project
The application is designed to support for project Nature Publication Quality Improvement Project (NPQIP).

Nature Journals introduced a change in their editorial policy which required authors in the life sciences to complete a checklist in their submissions, indicating whether or not they had taken certain measures which might reduce the risk of bias and to report key experimental and analytical details. NPQIP (protocol) is a study that assesses any impact of this change.
