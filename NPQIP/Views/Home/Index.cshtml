    @*<h3>Background</h3>

    <p>
        Few publications describing in vivo and in vitro research report taking measures which might reduce the risk of bias in their findings (Ioannidis et al., 2014; Macleod et al., 2015),
        and those which do not report such measures give inflated estimates of biological effects (Crossley et al., 2008; Hirst et al., 2014).
        Measures which may improve the quality of reports of in vivo and in vitro research have been endorsed by a large number of journals, 
        however, there is evidence that this endorsement has not been matched by a substantial increase in the quality of published reports (Baker et al., 2014).

    <h3>The NPQIP study</h3>*@

    <p><em> Nature Journals </em> introduced a change in their editorial policy which required authors in the life sciences to complete a checklist in their submissions, indicating whether or not they had taken
        certain measures which might reduce the risk of bias and to report key experimental and analytical details. NPQIP (<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8 ">protocol</a>)
     is a study that assesses any impact of this change.</p>


    <p> Publications will be assessed and scored by two independent reviewers; a third reviewer will reconcile any discrepancies between the two reviewers. 
 </p>
  
    <p>
        This is a fantastic project to get involved in. By reviewing scientific papers as part of this project, you will have the opportunity to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contribute to improving the quality of pre-clinical in vivo and in vitro
   research
</li>
        <li>Gain impressive critical appraisal skills and increase your understanding
            of the level of reporting required in pre-clinical research
        </li>
        <li>Be credited as a collaborator in a high impact publication when the results are
            published – a fantastic step for scientists at all stages of their career (we plan
            for the listing of contributions to follow the format for the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25892679">AVERT trial </a>)
        </li>

        <li>You can also earn prizes for the number of manuscripts you review, such
   as a USB stick, Netflix/Spotify subscriptions and even iPads - find out
            more about the  <a href="@Url.Action("Reward","Home")">prizes here <i class="fa fa-tablet text-danger fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are currently recruiting new reviewers and would greatly appreciate your support as a collaborator. </p>

    <p>In order to become a reviewer on this project, we have set up a training module that is a prerequisite to becoming a reviewer.

        To register for the training, please <a class="btn btn-danger font-white" href="@Url.Action("Register", "Account")">sign up </a>
