NPQIP is a study assessing any impact of a change in Nature journals’ editorial policy on the reporting of measures which might reduce the risk of bias.

</p>    
    <p>
        Few publications describing in vivo research report taking measures which might reduce the risk of bias in their findings,
        and those which do not report such measures give inflated estimates of biological effects. Measures which might improve the quality of reports of in vivo research have been proposed (ARRIVE, Landis), 
        and while these have been endorsed by a large number of journals there is evidence that this endorsement has not been matched by a substantial increase in the quality of published reports (Baker er al. 2014).

       Poor replication of in vitro molecular and cellular biology studies has also been reported and linked in part to poor descriptions of the experimental and analytical details.

    <p>
        In May 2013 Nature Journals introduced a change in editorial policy which required authors of submissions in the life sciences to complete a checklist indicating whether or not they had taken certain measures which might reduce the risk of bias and to report key experimental and analytical details; and in their submission to detail where in the manuscript these issues were addressed. The purpose of this study is to assess any impact of this change.
